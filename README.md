This guide walks through the creation of a math utils library for:

- calculating the factorial of a number
- finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers
- checking if a number is a prime number

## Creating a New Rust Project

Create a new library with the following command:

```bash
cargo new --lib rust_math_utils
```

New directory will be created with a basic project structure. Created <span style="color:green;">Cargo.toml</span> file contains the package details and dependencies.
